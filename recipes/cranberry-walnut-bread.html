    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Yeasted bread has never been easier. This simple mixing method produces the most beautiful and crusty cranberry nut no knead bread with practically zero hands-on work!    
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups + 2 tbsp (390g) <strong>all purpose flour</strong> (spoon & leveled)</li>
        <li>2 tsp <strong>coarse sea salt</strong></li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Platinum Yeast from Red Star <strong>instant yeast</strong></li>
        <li>3/4 cup (95g) chopped <strong>nuts</strong></li>
        <li>3/4 cup (105g) dried <strong>cranberries</strong></li>
        <li>1 Tbsp <strong>honey</strong></li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cup (360ml) warm <strong>water</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>*No need to grease the bowl.* Stir the first 6 ingredients together in a large bowl. Stir in the warm water. The dough will be pretty sticky– don’t be tempted to add more flour– you want a sticky dough. Gently shape into a ball as best you can. Cover tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Set on the counter at room temperature (honestly any normal room temperature is fine!) and allow to rise for 12-18 hours. The dough will double in size, stick to the sides of the bowl, and be covered in air bubbles.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and, using lightly floured hands, shape into a ball as best you can. Doesn’t have to be perfect! Transfer dough to a large piece of parchment paper. (Large enough to fit inside your pot and one that is safe under such high heat. I use this parchment and it’s never been an issue.)</li>
        <li>Using a very sharp knife, gently score an X into the top. Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap and leave alone for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>During this 30 minutes, preheat the oven to 475°F (246°C). (Yes, very hot!) Place your dutch oven (with the lid) or heavy duty pot inside for 30 minutes so that it’s extremely hot before the dough is placed inside. After 30 minutes, remove the dutch oven from the oven and carefully place the dough inside by lifting it up with the parchment paper and sticking it all– the parchment paper included– inside the pot. Cover with the lid.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 minutes with the lid on. Carefully remove the lid and continue baking for 8-10 more minutes until the bread is golden brown. Remove pot from the oven, carefully remove the bread from the pot, and allow to cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes before breaking/slicing/serving.</li>
        <li>Cover and store leftover bread at room temperature for 1 week.</li>
